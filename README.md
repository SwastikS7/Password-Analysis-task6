## 🔑 Password Strength Results

| Password                        | Strength Level | Estimated Crack Time       |
|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| `password123`                   | Weak           | 1 month                   |
| `Summer2025`                    | Medium         | 7 months                  |
| `S!mpleP@ss2025`                | Strong         | 200 million years         |
| `MySuperStrongPassphrase!2025`  | Very Strong    | 52 decillion years        |

## 📝 Explanation of Results

1. **Weak Password (`password123`)**  
   - Common dictionary word + predictable numbers.  
   - Easily guessed in dictionary/brute force attacks.  
   - Only ~1 month crack time.

2. **Medium Password (`Summer2025`)**  
   - Adds capitalization and numbers.  
   - Still predictable (season + year pattern).  
   - Crackable in ~7 months with modern hardware.

3. **Strong Password (`S!mpleP@ss2025`)**  
   - Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
   - Resistant to dictionary and brute-force attacks.  
   - Estimated crack time ~200 million years.

4. **Very Strong Password (`MySuperStrongPassphrase!2025`)**  
   - Long passphrase + symbols + numbers.  
   - Extremely resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.  
   - Estimated crack time ~52 decillion years → practically unbreakable.

## 🔐 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

- ✅ Use at least **12–16 characters** (longer = stronger).  
- ✅ Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**.  
- ✅ Prefer **passphrases** (a series of random words with symbols).  
- ✅ Avoid dictionary words, personal info, or predictable patterns.  
- ✅ Use **unique passwords** for different accounts.  
- ✅ Store credentials in a **password manager**.  
- ✅ Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** whenever possible.

## ⚔️ Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force Attack** → tries all possible combinations until it succeeds.  
- **Dictionary Attack** → uses precompiled wordlists of common passwords.  
- **Credential Stuffing** → attackers reuse leaked username/password combos.  
- **Social Engineering / Phishing** → tricks the user into revealing passwords.  
- **Keylogging & Malware** → captures keystrokes to steal passwords.

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Short and simple passwords (like `password123`) are **easily crackable**.  
- Adding numbers and capitalization helps but is **not enough**.  
- Including **special characters + longer length** massively increases security.  
- **Passphrases** offer both **memorability and strength**.  
- Complexity directly translates into **exponential increases in crack time**.

## 📖 Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security
- Password strength is not just about characters used but also **length + randomness**.  
- Attackers rely on speed — the more complex the password, the more time/resources needed.  
- A weak password can fall in **days or months**, while a strong one could take **millions of years**.  
- **Conclusion:** Longer, more complex passwords are the foundation of strong cybersecurity.
